# Inspiration

Growing up in Sai Gon, I developed a strong connection to the people, culture, and natural beauty of my hometown. I was particularly fascinated by [Dong Ho paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%90%C3%B4ng_H%E1%BB%93_painting), which have a rich history in Vietnam dating back to the 17th century. The charming illustrations and humorous storyline of a tale about two rats in love who must overcome obstacles to be married inspired me to create "Mice Wedding". Through this game, I aim to share this story with others in a fun and interactive way while also introducing them to Vietnamese culture.

# Gameplay & Technologies

"Mice Wedding" is a 2D game featuring two levels of gameplay, where players control a group of mice using touch and swipe gestures to collect leaves and avoid the cat. The game offers unique challenges and obstacles in each level to keep players engaged.

* SpriteKit, a 2D game engine, was utilized to create smooth and responsive animations for the game's characters and objects.
* SKPhysicsContactDelegate protocol was used to manage the game's physics and collision detection, ensuring accurate and reliable collision detection between objects.
* SKActions were employed to create natural-looking movements and animations, while data structures like ArrayList and loops were used to manage different node categories and set properties.
